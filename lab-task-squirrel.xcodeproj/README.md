## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
While building the app, the challenges I faced had to do with importing the lab files onto my project file to be able to use it as a structure. You can see that I ended up using the lab file itself to be able to build the app and go about it in that way. I was also having trouble with the “view photo” file, specifically with the constraints of the size of the image and how to center it.
